#  bucalarm-api

Simple WSGI api to serve as backend for home alarm application.

The goal of this app is to make a streamlined application to use in my LibreELEC Raspberry Pi
I'm only using native python modules as i can't install anything on LibreELEC (Read Only FS)

Feel free to modify or contact me.
